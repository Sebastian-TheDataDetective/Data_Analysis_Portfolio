# Data_Analysis_Portfolio_Projects
# Introduction
Hi!

Welcome to my Portfolio. My name is Sebastian Lotanna Nnorom and I am excited to share my data analysis projects here!

I have a technical/research background and hold a PhD in Petroleum Geoscience from The University of Manchester, with a major in 3D Seismic Interpretation of fluid flow features (Sandstone Intrusions or Sand Injectites). After about a year of transitioning from geoscience to Data Analysis, due to my passion for working with numbers, I am currently searching for opportunities (internships and full-time jobs) to improve and apply my data skills. I have over the past year acquired the necessary skills needed to kickstart my new found interest in data analysis.

In subsequent sections, I will provide a brief description and summary of my projects. The projects will demonstrate the following skills: cleaning and preparing data for analysis, analysing data to identify trends, querying a relational database with SQL and creating data visualisation and dashboards. These projects were carried out using the following tools: EXCEL, TABLEAU, PYTHON, SQLite.

Finally, this repository serves as a means to showcase my data skills, and a platform to share my projects and track my progress in data analytics.

# Projects
## Project 1: Explore a Dataset on Energy Usage and Draw Conclusions

**Description:** In this project, dataset from a domestic and industrial energy supplier was analyzed to understand how to efficiently manage supply of electricity. In other toachieve the above, some important questions were raised based on the available data, to guide my analaysis. These questions include:

i). What does demand look like over time? - To show and understand how demand varies over time (day of week/month/year).

ii). What does extreme demand look like, and under what circumstances does it happen? - To identify/highlight what happens during extreme demand, what       causes it and when it does happen.

iii). How do factors like weather and holidays affect demand? - To understand how/if weather conditions and holidays affect demand

The project includes the following steps: data loading; data cleaning, sorting and formatting, data visualization

**Skills:** Data cleaning and Data exploration (analysis and visualization)

**Technology/Tools:** Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets


## Project 2: Create a Dashboard Meeting Business Requirements



## Project 3: Assess the Quality of a Dataset for a Public Service Agency



## Project 4: Retrieve User Activity Data on an Online Forum Using SQL
