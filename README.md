# Introduction
Hi!

Welcome to my Portfolio. My name is Sebastian Nnorom and I am excited to share my data analysis projects here!

I have a technical/research background and hold a PhD in Petroleum Geoscience from The University of Manchester, with a major in 3D Seismic Interpretation of fluid flow features (Sandstone Intrusions or Snad Injectites). After about a year of transitioning from geoscience to Data Analysis, due to my passion for working with numbers, I am currently searching for opportunities (internships and full-time jobs) to improve and apply my data skills. I have over the past year acquired the necessary skills needed to kickstart my new found interest in data analysis.

In subsequent sections, I will provide a brief description and summary of my projects in each folder.
